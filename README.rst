Overview
--------

This app makes rendering PDF files in Django really easy.
It can be used to create invoices, bills and other documents
from simple HTML markup and CSS styles. You can even embed images
and use custom fonts.

The library provides both Class-Based View that is almost a drop-in
replacement for Django's ``TemplateView`` as well as helper functions
to render PDFs in the backend outside the request scope
(i.e. using Celery workers).


Quickstart
----------

1. Include ``django-easy-pdf>=0.2.0`` and ``WeasyPrint>=0.34`` in your ``requirements.txt`` file
   and install necessary system packages.

2. Add ``easy_pdf`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

3. Create HTML template for PDF document and add a view that will render it:

    .. code-block:: css+django

        {% extends "easy_pdf/base.html" %}

        {% block content %}
            <div id="content">
                <h1>Hi there!</h1>
            </div>
        {% endblock %}

    .. code-block:: python

        from easy_pdf.views import PDFTemplateView

        class HelloPDFView(PDFTemplateView):
            template_name = 'hello.html'
